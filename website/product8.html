        <p class="product-description">
            Rugs and carpets are essential elements of interior design that enhance both comfort and style in any space. Rugs, available in various sizes and patterns, can define areas within a room, adding warmth and texture. They are perfect for creating cozy atmospheres and can easily be swapped out for seasonal updates. Carpets, on the other hand, cover larger areas, providing a soft foundation underfoot while also contributing to insulation and sound absorption. Both rugs and carpets come in diverse materials and designs, making them versatile choices for enhancing the aesthetic and comfort of your home.
