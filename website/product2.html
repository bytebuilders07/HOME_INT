        <p class="product-description">
            Mirrors and medicine cabinets are essential fixtures in any home, combining style with functionality. Mirrors enhance the visual space by reflecting light and creating an illusion of depth, while medicine cabinets offer practical storage for toiletries and medications. Often featuring mirrored doors, these cabinets keep essentials organized and easily accessible, making them perfect for smaller bathrooms. Together, they contribute to a clean, stylish aesthetic while maximizing utility in daily routines.
